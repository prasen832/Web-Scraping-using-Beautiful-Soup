# Web Scraping using Beautiful Soup and Python

## What is web scrapping ?

Web scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites. It involves fetching the web page's HTML code and then parsing it to extract the desired information. This process is often automated using scripts or programs to navigate through the website's structure and retrieve specific data.

Here's a basic outline of how web scraping works:

1. Requesting the Web Page: The first step is to send an HTTP request to the targeted website to retrieve the HTML content of the page.

2. Downloading HTML Content: Once the request is successful, the HTML content of the web page is downloaded.

3. Parsing HTML: The HTML content is then parsed to extract relevant information. This involves identifying the HTML elements that contain the data you want and using techniques like XPath or CSS selectors to navigate the document.

4. Data Extraction: After parsing the HTML, the desired data is extracted from the selected elements. This could be text, images, links, or any other information present on the webpage.

5. Storing the Data: Finally, the extracted data can be stored in a structured format, such as a database, CSV file, or any other suitable storage method.

It's important to note that web scraping should be done ethically and legally. Before scraping a website, it's advisable to check the website's terms of service to ensure compliance.
